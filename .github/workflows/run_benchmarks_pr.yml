# Run benchmarks on pull requests and post a comment back detailing the results.
# Unlike benchmarks on pushes, these results are not committed back to the repo.
# The purpose here is to provide performance view before merging a PR.
# This will only be run if the PR has the label "preview-benchmark-results"
# and will be skipped if the label is removed.
