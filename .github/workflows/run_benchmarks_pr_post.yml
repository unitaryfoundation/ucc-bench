# After one of the `run_benchmarks_pr_ucc*yml` workflows completes, this
# will dispatch to post the resulting comment back to the originating PR.
# The triggering job will have saved the contents of the comment in a
# comments.json build artifact file.
#
# We perform this is a separate step because this job needs elevated permissions
# to post the comment, whereas the job to run the benchmarks runs contributed code
# and shouldn't have access to such permissions.
