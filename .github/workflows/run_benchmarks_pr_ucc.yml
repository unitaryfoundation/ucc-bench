# When triggered (by a PR in the ucc repo), run benchmarks and post a comment back detailing the results.
# Unlike benchmarks on pushes to main, these results are not committed back to the repo.
# The purpose here is to provide performance view before merging a PR.

# !!This workflow is triggered by PRs in the ucc repo and comments back to that repo.
