# When triggered (by a PR in the ucc repo), run benchmarks and generates a comment detailing the results.
# Unlike benchmarks on pushes to main, these results are not committed back to the repo.
# The purpose here is to provide performance view before merging a PR.
#
# This job only runs and generates the comments. A subsequent run_benchmarks_pr_post will be
# triggered to do the post. These are separate steps because this job is running 3rd party contributed
# code, and should not have access to the secrets needed to post a PR comment.
#
# !!This workflow is triggered by PRs in the ucc repo and comments back to that repo.
# !!For PRs to the ucc-bench repo, the there is a `run_benchmarks_pr.yml` workflow that
# !!is triggered
