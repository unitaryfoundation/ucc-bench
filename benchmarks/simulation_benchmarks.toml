# --------- Benchmarks ----------
# Define the set of individual benchmarks
# This benchmarks add a simulation stage to calculate some observable or metric
# on the pre-post compiled circuits with and without noise to see the impact of the
# compiler on performance.
# For now, we use a common depolarizing noise model that is defined entirely in the code.
# In the future, we could expand to make the noise model, or its parameters, configurable
# as well.
